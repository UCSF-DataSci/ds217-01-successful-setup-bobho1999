## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
[What excites you about programming/data science? What concerns or uncertainties do you have?]
I am definitely excited about the different data science application on health related field. However, as someone who came from a data science background, I have little to no knowledge in health domain. Therefore, I am slightly unsure how seriously it would impede the journey.
